# Product_recognition

Computer Vison and Image Processing course exam project

I'm sorry but I don't have the orginal assignment given by teacher

I had to perform 3 step of product recognition:
- Step A: find if there is the product on the scene (it was 1 to 1 or 1 to 0 match)
- Step B: find if and how many match there was for each product (basically step A but could be 1 to many match)
- Step C: perform step B for a whole shelve
